# UnionFindAndProblems
This is a few of the union find problem I solved and found interesting while doing the coursera course by princeton university on algorithms.
# Python implementation
First I have several implementations for union find of different kinds in python. I did these before watching the lectures, then built the lecture solutions as they were going.
# Java Implementation
I then built the optimal solution in Java to see how well I understood it.
# Percolation
I also have a percolution file, this is a problem where we have an n x n grid of cells, and each cell is either open or closed.
We need to identify if there is a connected component that touches the top and the bottom.
# SuccessorProblem
There is an interesting problem in one of the questionaires about a problem where you have a set of number 0..n-1 and you can remove numbers from the set, and you need to be able to find the succesor (smallest number in the set greater than or equal to) any other number. The goal is to see if you can have logorithmic time complexity for both operations.
